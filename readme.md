RxJS-Barebones

RxJS-Barebones is a deep exploration into the fundamental principles of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). The project aims to derive and implement standard RxJS operators using only two core operators: map and flatMap. This minimalist approach emphasizes the power of Functional Programming (FP) concepts like Functor and Monad, offering an insightful exercise for those passionate about FP and RxJS.

🌟 Vision

RxJS-Barebones is a journey to:

Understand: Deconstruct RxJS operators into their simplest behaviors.

Simplify: Highlight the expressive power of a minimal core operator set.

Educate: Provide a platform for developers to learn and practice FP concepts through RxJS.

🛠️ Features

Derived Operators: Standard RxJS operators implemented using only map and flatMap.

Documentation: Detailed explanations of operator derivations and FP principles.

Examples: Real-world scenarios demonstrating the practical use of derived operators.

Unit Tests: Comparative tests to validate the behavior of derived operators against their native RxJS counterparts.
